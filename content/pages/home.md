Hello and welcome to my website! I recently finished my undergraduate degree at the [University of Toronto](https://www.utoronto.ca/) studying computer science and math. 

I will be returning to uoft next fall to continue my studies as a graduate student of the [MScAC](https://mscac.utoronto.ca/) program. I'm interested in exploring optimizing existing machine learning methods because I believe any improvements (for example: algorithmic, architectural, or security) expands the possible applications of ML.
