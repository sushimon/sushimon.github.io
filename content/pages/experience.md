Title: experience
sortorder: 3

I've been fortunate enough to have a wide range of experiences spanning education, research, and what I consider to be industry-adjacent work. This page talks about my experiences, thoughts, and motivations.

## teaching
I've always known how important of a role educators play in our lives, but never truly understood this until my grade 10 math teacher helped shape me into who I am today (thank you Mr. Jessa). This along with my experience with [MAT137](https://artsci.calendar.utoronto.ca/course/mat137y1), a notoriously difficult first year calculus course at uoft, made me want to become a teaching assistant to support students, especially in such a formative course in their undergrad. 

I've been a teaching assistant for MAT137 for 2023-2024 and 2024-2025 academic years, and hope to be able to continue teaching in graduate school.


## research
Throughout all the courses I took in my undergrad, I always appreciated the theoretical CS courses a tad bit more. Of course, practical implementation is important but there was something liberating in just exploring the potential of things. My preconceived notion of research was that it was mainly theoretical so, naturally, I started to wonder what conducting research would be like.

In the summer of 2024, I was fortunate to land a position as a research assistant under the supervision of [Gururaj Saileshwar](https://gururaj-s.github.io/) as part of uoft's [UTEA](https://www.registrar.utoronto.ca/finances-and-funding/utea/) program. I worked alongside another student to create a new performant and secure way for many devices to collaboratively train a model. I worked on porting the [Shakespeare](https://leaf.cmu.edu/) implementation to the latest version of [Flower](https://flower.ai/), conducting experiments to quantify the impact of our new algorithm, and prepared research poster to summarize our findings.


## industry (kinda)
While not exactly in industry, this was my first structured work environment where I contributed to a software project. I was working on PythonTA, an educational code analysis tool, as part of the Students Developing Software team under the supervision of [David Liu](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~david/).

I worked on a total of 25 tasks over two semesters which included developing new features such as more user-friendly configuration and the generation of control flow graphs. I also learned how to use Git, and summarize and present my work.
